Haven't you ever dreamt of writing code in a very high level language and have that code execute at speeds rivaling that of lower-level languages? PyGPU is a compiler that lets you write image processing programs in Python that execute on the graphics processing unit (GPU) present in modern graphics cards. This enables image processing algorithms to take advantage of the performance of the GPU. In some applications, performance increases approach an order of magnitude, compared to CPUs.

This project is defunct, if you want to use it for anything please mail me. I will try to answer questions as best I can. However, due to time constraints, I cannot provide support.
